<h2>Installation instructions</h2>
Place the directory in \Steam\skins\. After you’ve extracted the contents of the archive you go to <i>Settings</i> › <i>Interface</i> and select the Compact skin.

<br><strong>Linux users:</strong> Read the included readme for instructions how to install this skin on Linux. A few issues with fonts requires some manual work. Please let me know if you experience any issues with this, I haven’t tested it much myself.
